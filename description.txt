Cookie Clicker, ported to Terraria!

This mod ports the basic features of Cookie Clicker to Terraria (cookies, the store, upgrades, sugar lumps, etc.)!
Data is saved per player, and you can't reset your progress on players.
This mod also has achievements (which are saved separately from players)! You can view them on the main menu!
This mod doesn't add any actual content to the game, it's just a fun little mod to pass the time. :P
